Organizations are groups that tie together users, workspaces, and images. You
must assign all of your images and workspaces to a specific organization. An
end-user can only access images that are assigned to the same organization they
are.

> Be sure to familiarize yourself with the [types of
> roles](access-control/organizations.md) you can assign users within an
> organization.

## The default organization

When you first set up Coder, you'll generate the default organization. You can
then assign users and their workspaces to that organization.

There must always be a default organization, but you can change the one set as
the default once you have two or more organizations.

## Create a new organization

Site admins and site managers can create new organizations by going to
**Manage** > **Organizations** > **New Organization**.

![Create a new organization dialog](../assets/create-an-org.png)

Provide a **name** and (optionally) a **description** for this organization. If
you want this to become your **Default organization**, make sure to check the
box for this.

You can also control how Coder manages resources for workspaces in this
organization. You can set the:

- **CPU Provisioning Rate**: sets the ratio of virtual CPUs to physical CPUs; if
  you set a higher ratio, you can schedule a larger number of workspaces per
  node, though it will also lead to greater CPU contention
- **Workspace Shutdown Behavior**: The number of hours a workspace may be idle
  before Coder stops it automatically to help free up resources

Finally, you can set **Resource Quotas**. These are limits on the number of
**CPUs** and **GPUs**, as well as the amount of **memory** and **disk space**,
each developer can use across *all* of their workspaces in this organization.

When you've set your parameters, click **Create** to proceed.

## Editing an organization

You can edit an organization at any time by going to **Manage** >
**Organizations**.

![Edit an organization dialog](../assets/edit-an-org.png)

Find the organization you want to edit, and click to open. In the top-right,
click **Edit** to launch the **Edit Organizations** dialog.

When you're finished making your changes, click **Update** to save.

## Namespaces

> **Deprecation notice**: The `namespaceWhitelist` field has been deprecated in
> [Coder version 1.17](../changelog/1.17.0.md).

Coder's Helm chart previously included a `namespaceWhitelist` field that
accepted a list of cluster namespaces and made them available to Coder. The
[workspace provider feature](workspace-providers/index.md) supersedes this
field.

You will not be able to make any changes _unless_ you are removing namespaces
that no longer contain workspaces with Coder deployments v1.17.0 or later (if
you remove namespaces from the `namespaceWhitelist` field, the workspaces in the
namespaces are no longer accessible).

For older Coder deployments, you can continue using existing workspaces in
whitelisted namespaces, though you cannot create new workspaces in those
namespaces.

If you want to separate Coder workspaces by namespaces in a Kubernetes cluster,
you can do so by [deploying a new workspace
provider](workspace-providers/deployment.md) to each additional namespace in
the cluster. The workspace provider provisions workspaces to the namespace it
has been deployed to, and you can control access to each workspace provider via
an organization allowlist to replace the previous organization namespace
behaviors.
